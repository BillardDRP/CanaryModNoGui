# How to install:
Drop startOSX.command in your canarymod folder.

Then use Terminal (located in <code>Applications/Utilites </code>) to navigate to your CanaryMod Folder by using the <code>cd</code>. Once you are there (verify by typing <code>ls</code>), type <code>chmod 777 startOSX</code> in terminal, you only have to do this once.
#### NOTE: <code>chmod</code> can mess up your computer as it changes the way your comuter handles files and is even more dangerous than sudo (super user) and is used here in a way that WILL NOT harm your computer. 
Then later on if you want to launch it, simply drag startOSX.command into a terminal window and press enter to start the server.

# Commands and player count
To run server commands in terminal, just type them the same way you would in canarymod normally and press enter. To see amount and a list of players, type <code>/list</code>.

# Got questions?
List them as an issue in THIS repo and I will answer them asap.

##### Happy travels!
